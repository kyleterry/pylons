Development Version
===================

`Subersion <http://subversion.tigris.org>`_ must be installed to retrieve the latest development version of Pylons. Subersion packages are available from `here <http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html#binary-packages>`_.

Read the `Easy Install documentation <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_, to decide whether to install Pylons as a root user so it can be used by everyone or whether to use a `custom installation location <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#custom-installation-locations>`_ then download `ez_setup.py <http://pylonshq.com/files/ez_setup.py>`_ and run::
    
    python ez_setup.py -U http://pylonshq.com/svn/Pylons/trunk


Checking out the source code
----------------------------

Check out the latest code::
	
	svn co http://pylonshq.com/svn/Pylons/trunk Pylons

To tell setuptools to use the version you are editing in the ``Pylons`` directory::

	cd Pylons
	python setup.py develop
	
Now you can make changes to the files in the Pylons directory and the code will run exactly as if you had installed a version of the egg with the changes you have made.
